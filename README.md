# Projects Portfolio

## Description 

This is repo is for my porfolio website, where all my projects can be found. This portfolio is to showcase my Software Development skills as I go through this learning journey.
  

In the latest iteration of this portfolio, I am showcasing mostly my CSS and HTML skills. Expect this portfolio to grow as more projects will be added as I continue learning and go to learn Javascript and frameworks such as React.

## Installation/Access
The portfolio has been deployed on GitHub pages and can be accessed via this link:  
https://dumisilem.github.io/Dumisile_Portfolio/




## Usage 
To view each project, simply scroll to the 'Work' section of page and click on any of project images/titles, the project should open.     
### Troubleshooting
- When viewing the webiste, ensure to clear cache to ensure that images are visible
- When testing out the responsiveness, and it looks like the site is not responsive,
try  refreshing the page.

For reference, this is what the website should look like:
