# Projects Portfolio

## Description 

This is repo is for my porfolio website, where all my projects can be found. This portfolio is to showcase my Software Development skills as I go through this learning journey.
  

In the latest iteration of this portfolio, I am showcasing mostly my CSS and HTML skills. Expect this portfolio to grow as more projects will be added as I continue learning and go to learn Javascript and frameworks such as React.

## Installation/Access
